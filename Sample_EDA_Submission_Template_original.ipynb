Each bar represents a specific room type, and the height of the bar reflects the average price, making it easy to compare the pricing visually.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Clarity and Readability**: The bar graph is straightforward and easy to read, making it suitable for presenting insights to a wide range of audiences, including non-technical stakeholders. The clear visualization allows viewers to understand the price differences between room types across different neighborhood groups.\n",
        "\n",
